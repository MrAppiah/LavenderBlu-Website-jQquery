				<h2>Privacy &mdash; Notice</h2>
				<p class="privacy-notice-pages">
					At Lavender Blu we respect the privacy of the children attending the
					Club and the privacy of their parents or carers, as well as the
					privacy of our staff. Our aim is to ensure that all those using and
					working at Lavender Blu can do so with confidence that their personal
					data is being kept secure. Lavender blu ensures that the club meets
					the requirements of the GDPR, liaises with statutory bodies when
					necessary, and responds to any subject access requests.
					<br /><br /><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br /><br />
					Within the Club we respect confidentiality in the following ways:
				</p>
				<ul class="privacy-notice-list-pages">
					<li>
						We will only ever share information with a parent about their own
						child.
					</li>

					<li>
						Information given by parents to Club staff about their child will
						not be passed on to third parties without permission unless there is
						a safeguarding issue (as covered in our Safeguarding Policy).
					</li>

					<li>
						Concerns or evidence relating to a child’s safety, will be kept in a
						confidential file and will not be shared within the club, except
						with the designated child protection officer and the manager.
					</li>

					<li>
						Staff only discuss individual children for purposes of planning and
						group management.
					</li>

					<li>
						Staff are made aware of the importance of confidentiality during
						their induction process.
					</li>

					<li>
						Issues relating to the employment of staff, whether paid or
						voluntary, will remain confidential to those making personnel
						decisions.
					</li>

					<li>All personal data is stored securely in a lockable file.</li>

					<li>
						Students on work placements and volunteers are informed of our Data
						Protection policy and are required to respect it.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Information that we keep</strong><br /><br />
					The items of personal data that we keep about individuals are
					documented on our personal data matrix. The personal data matrix is
					reviewed annually to ensure that any new data types are included.
					Children and parents: We hold only the information necessary to
					provide a childcare service for each child. This includes child
					registration information, medical information, parent contact
					information, attendance records, incident and accident records and so
					forth. Once a child leaves our care we retain only the data required
					by statutory legislation and industry best practice, and for the
					prescribed periods of time. Electronic data that is no longer required
					is deleted and paper records are disposed of securely. Staff: We keep
					information about employees to meet HMRC requirements, and to comply
					with all other areas of employment legislation. We retain the
					information after a member of staff has left our employment for the
					recommended period of time, then it is deleted or destroyed as
					necessary.
					<br /><br /><strong>Sharing information with third parties</strong
					><br /><br />
					We will only share child information with outside agencies on a
					need-to-know basis and with consent from parents, except in cases
					relating to safeguarding children, criminal activity, or if required
					by legally authorised bodies (e.g. Police, HMRC, etc). If we decide to
					share information without parental consent, we will record this in the
					child’s file, clearly stating our reasons. We will only share relevant
					information that is accurate and up to date. Our primary commitment is
					to the safety and well-being of the children in our care. Some limited
					personal information is disclosed to authorised third parties we have
					engaged to process it, as part of the normal running of our business,
					for example in order to take online bookings, and to manage our
					payroll and accounts. Any such third parties comply with the strict
					data protection regulations of the GDPR.
					<br /><br /><strong>Subject access requests</strong>
				</p>
				<ul class="privacy-notice-list-pages">
					<li>
						Parents/carers can ask to see the information and records relating
						to their child, and/or any information that we keep about
						themselves.
					</li>

					<li>
						Staff and volunteers can ask to see any information that we keep
						about them.
					</li>

					<li>
						We will make the requested information available as soon as
						practicable and will respond to the request within one month at the
						latest.
					</li>

					<li>
						If our information is found to be incorrect or out of date, we will
						update it promptly.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If any individual about whom we hold data has a complaint about how we
					have kept their information secure, or how we have responded to a
					subject access request, they may complain to the Information
					Commissioner’s Office (ICO).
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>GDPR</strong>
					We comply with the requirements of the General Data Protection
					Regulation (GDPR), regarding obtaining, storing and using personal
					data.
